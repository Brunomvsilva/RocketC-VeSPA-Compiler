## Introduction

**RocketC** is a custom C compiler developed specifically for the **VeSPA processor**, a RISC-based System-on-Chip implemented on FPGA.

It compiles C programs into **VeSPA Assembly** and **machine code**, which can then be executed on the hardware.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a full compilation flow capable of generating executable code for the VeSPA architecture, enabling high-level programming on a custom-built CPU.

## TEAM  

➡️ This project was developed by a team of 20 students as part of the Embedded Systems course. 

➡️ The class was organized into three groups, which rotated roles throughout the semester to cover different stages of the development process

➡️ The roles were:

- Rocket C Compiler Frontend - Current Repository  
- Rocket C Compiler Backend - Current Repository
- [CPU Pipeline (SoC Team)](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/VESPA-SoC.git)

## Lexical Analysis

Lexical analysis is the **first stage of the compiler**. Its role is to read the input C source code and convert it into a sequence of **tokens**.
Anything that doesn't match the expected patterns of the language is reported as a **lexical error**.
As stated before, this was implemented using the open source GNU Flex tool.

**GNU Flex**

- Flex reads a specification file (`.l`) containing **regular expressions for tokens**.
- It generates a C source file that scans the input program and **produces tokens**.
- These tokens are then passed to the syntax parser (Bison).

**Why Flex is used:**
- Fast and efficient token scanning  
- Easy integration with C and Bison/Yacc  
- Supports regular expressions for easy token definition  
- Commonly used in real compilers (GCC, Clang, etc.)

The following elements were defined in the **lexer**:  
**reserved words**, **special symbols**, and their corresponding **regular expressions**.

> **Limitations:**  
> The following C features are **not supported** in this version of the compiler:  
> `struct`, `typedef`, `enum`, `union`, `sizeof`, `->`, `.`
