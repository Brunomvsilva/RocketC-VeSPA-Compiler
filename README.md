## Introduction

**RocketC** is a custom C compiler developed specifically for the **VeSPA processor**, a RISC-based System-on-Chip implemented on FPGA.

It compiles C programs into **VeSPA Assembly** and **machine code**, which can then be executed on the hardware.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a full compilation flow capable of generating executable code for the VeSPA architecture, enabling high-level programming on a custom-built CPU.

## TEAM  

➡️ This project was developed by a team of 20 students as part of the Embedded Systems course. 

➡️ The class was organized into three groups, which rotated roles throughout the semester to cover different stages of the development process

➡️ The roles were:

- Rocket C Compiler Frontend - Current Repository  
- Rocket C Compiler Backend - Current Repository
- [CPU Pipeline (SoC Team)](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/VESPA-SoC.git)

## Repository Components

| Folder | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| [`Assembler/`](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/RocketC-VeSPA-Compiler/tree/main/Assembler) | Contains Assembler code, which turns **VeSPA Assembly into machine code** (`.coe` / binary format). |
| [`Compiler/`](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/RocketC-VeSPA-Compiler/tree/main/Compiler) | Contains the **RocketC VeSPA Compiler code** |
| [`Instruction Scheduler/`](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/RocketC-VeSPA-Compiler/tree/main/Instruction%20Scheduler) | Includes the **Instruction Scheduler**, used to reduce hazards generated by the compiler in VeSPA code. |
| [`Simulator/`](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/RocketC-VeSPA-Compiler/tree/main/Simulator) | **RocketSim - Software simulator for the VeSPA CPU**, capable of executing assembly/binary programs step-by-step. |
