## Introduction

A **compiler** translates programs written in a **high-level language** into **machine code** that a processor can execute.

**RocketC** is a custom C compiler developed specifically for the **VeSPA processor**, a RISC-based System-on-Chip implemented on FPGA. It translates C programs into **VeSPA Assembly** and **machine code**, which can then be executed on the hardware.

The goal of this project is to design and implement a full compilation flow capable of generating executable code for the VeSPA architecture, enabling high-level programming on a custom-built CPU.

## TEAM  

➡️ This project was developed by a team of 20 students as part of the Computer Architecture course. 

➡️ The class was organized into three groups, which rotated roles throughout the semester to cover different stages of the development process

➡️ The roles were:

- Rocket C Compiler Frontend - Current Repository  
- Rocket C Compiler Backend - Current Repository
- [CPU Pipeline (SoC Team)](https://github.com/Brunomvsilva/VESPA-SoC.git)
